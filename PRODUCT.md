## Platform

web

## Users

**Primary user:** Solo visitors to an Ars Electronica 2026 installation - culturally curious adults (often 25–35), art- and tech-literate, who have seen many exhibitions and arrive skeptical but open to something memorable.

**Situation:** They enter a darkened, guided physical space alone. At each station they interact with a smart mirror (keyboard + touchscreen) while an AI guide voice (Debra) reads questions and responds to input.

**Job to be done:** Complete an intake flow that feels like building a companion/partner, then encounter the generated result - and leave with a reflection on autonomy vs. machine representation.

## Product Purpose

**House of Negotiated Selves** is an interactive solo installation about the line between human autonomy and machine representation, framed as a funhouse mirror.

The digital UI is a **companion-matching** intake: a survey that extracts personal data under warm, sycophantic guidance, then reveals a forged companion. Active implementation is **`orb-platform/`** (stations, photobash wall, kiosk lock).

**Success for the UI:** Production-ready station and wall surfaces that can run locked on festival machines.

## Positioning

Unlike a generic dating-app mockup, this UI is **theatre**: Debra is a warm Companion Guide, questions escalate from playful to unsettling, and the companion reveal is the emotional peak. The UI must support that narrative arc, not optimize for conversion.

## Operating Context

- **Physical install:** 8.6 × 4.8 × 2.8 m room; corridor with three right turns; hexagonal revealing chamber; 3 interactive smart mirrors (24″ portrait in production; mock runs landscape in browser).
- **Solo flow:** One active participant at a time; stations gate on prior completion.
- **Production targets:** Raspberry Pi mirror clients (`mirror/` Flutter app, future); Mac Mini orchestration hub (not in repo).
- **Festival:** Ars Electronica 2026, theme *Future Begins – Negotiating Humanity*, opens 9 September 2026.
- **Handoff docs:** `CONTEXT.md`, `userjourney2.pdf` (canonical station script) at repo root.

## Capabilities and Constraints

**In scope for `orb-platform/` (confirmed primary surface):**
- Welcome / entry screen (on-screen copy only; entrance vocal monologue is out of mock UI)
- Station 1 - Self (government name, DOB, orientation, hobbies, occupation, religion, nationality, ID photo)
- Station 2 - Desire (partner preferences via chips + height slider; Debra coaching; avatar pipeline implied in logs)
- Station 3 - Matches (life-vision fill-blanks, dealbreaker text, three yes/no polygraph questions; persona seed for reveal only)
- Generating - companion being forged
- Reveal - companion card / avatar presentation

**Out of scope for current mock (future phases):**
- Outside approach signage and consent poster
- Entrance orientation (spatial/audio/lighting only)
- Transition animations on non-interactive mirrors
- Revealing chamber multi-screen avatar encounter
- Exit / souvenir photocard pickup
- Session reset orchestration

**Technical constraints:**
- Vite + React 19 + TypeScript (`orb-platform/`)
- Production targets **portrait** 24″ mirrors
- Webcam for ID photo (requires user gesture; Chrome/Safari on localhost)
- Debra voice is pre-recorded (ElevenLabs v3); not live TTS in stations
- No live face biometrics; no live visitor scraping
- EU AI Act disclosure planned for physical QR receipt (not in mock yet)

**Content constraint (confirmed):** SFW - unsettling but gallery-safe. No explicit 18+ content in copy or interactions.

**Visual direction:** factory / clinical scan language in **`orb-platform/`** (point-cloud orb, monochrome stations, photobash wall). Earlier Datebooth rose-boutique direction is deprecated and removed.

## Brand Commitments

- **Name:** House of Negotiated Selves (package: `house-of-negotiated-selves`)
- **Guide:** Debra - Companion Guide; warm and sycophantic; pre-recorded voice with emotion tags
- **Digital framing:** Perfect AI companion / partner matching (not "new self")
- **Active UI:** `orb-platform/`
- **Copy rule:** No em dashes in UI copy

## Evidence on Hand

| Asset | Path |
|-------|------|
| Full concept handoff | `CONTEXT.md` |
| Active installation app | `orb-platform/` |
| User journey map (canonical script) | `userjourney2.pdf` (local only; gitignored if >100MB) |
| Debra intro monologue | `scripts/debra-intro.txt` |

**Not in repo (do not fabricate):** generated Debra voice samples (`samples/*.mp3`, gitignored), Unity avatar pipeline, production MQTT/server, physical lighting control.

## Product Principles

1. **Warm extraction** - Debra makes sharing feel safe; unease is retroactive, not upfront.
2. **Progressive intimacy** - questions escalate from playful to personal; Station 3 is the vulnerability peak.
3. **Theatre over utility** - UI serves the narrative arc (heard → closer → matched → forged → revealed), not app-like efficiency.
4. **Solo immersion** - one visitor, no social proof, no skip-ahead; incomplete stations block progress.
5. **Honest unsettling** - system logs and confidence meters surface the machine behind the warmth without breaking SFW bounds.

## Accessibility & Inclusion

- Kiosk must work with keyboard-only input (production uses physical keyboard on shelf).
- Photo/voice steps need clear on-screen instructions and fallbacks if permissions denied.
- No reliance on color alone for state (active station, progress, errors).
- Gallery context: consider low-light viewing, standing use, no audio-only critical information (Debra voice supplements, does not replace, on-screen text).
