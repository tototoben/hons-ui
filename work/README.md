## Relationship to repo root

| Root folder | Team folder | Notes |
|-------------|-------------|-------|
| `mirror/` | `work/eka-ars26-house/mirror/` | Same Flutter sim; root copy may drift — **team repo is source of truth** for production |
| `orb-platform/` | — | Active installation app (stations + photobash wall) |

Pull team changes from `tototoben/eka-ars26-house`; push UI work from `martinorav-png/house-of-negotiated-selves`.
